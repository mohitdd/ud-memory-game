# Memory Game Project

Classic Memory Game

### How to play

* Open index.html from the project in browser.
* Clicking on tiles will turn them over so that you can see what lies on them. 
* Your goal is to match two tiles of the same type at a time.
* Then try to match all pairs in as minimum moves as possible.
